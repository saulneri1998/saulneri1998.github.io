Description:
  Our project is an animated version of a self balancing binary search tree.
  The UI is divided as following:
    -A text box, for the inputs.
    -An add button, for adding new nodes into the tree.
    -A remove button, for removing nodes from the tree.
    -A download option, this will download a .png file of the canvas.
    -The canvas, where the action happens.
    -A restart button, in case you want to completely erase your tree.
